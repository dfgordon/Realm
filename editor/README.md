Notes on Editor Programs
========================

These are the programs that were originally used to create and manipulate maps and text files (n.b. maps have text embedded in them).  This is not necessarily an exhaustive set, just what was found on the Sider.

None of these programs have been used during the recovery project. Instead we use a python script to convert everything to `JSON` format, make any edits using a modern text editor, and use another script to convert back to the original format.  If we were making changes to the terrain it might be of some interest to improve `DEDIT.*`, but this is outside the current scope.

This folder also contains the original `MONSTERS` text file, which includes several monsters that were passed over by the encounter handler, and which in the modern version are simply deleted. The decision to eliminate them was made in the retro-era, based on the fact that the artwork was not going to fit on the monster disk. Note there is a half-finished `DEMON` in `artwork-editable`, so apparently he, at least, was going to be included (as of this writing he is still left out).
