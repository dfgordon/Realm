*Realm* Overview
=================

*Realm* is a retro adventure game. I developed it for the Apple \]\[ plus in the early 1980's, and updated it for the //e (unenhanced variety) a few years later, but never really finished. It was inspired mainly by [Ultima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_I:_The_First_Age_of_Darkness) and [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons).

Recovery Project
=================

During the COVID pandemic of 2020/21, I got the old Apple //e working again, and decided to get *Realm* and other things off the vintage storage and onto a modern system.  With modern tools this should be easy, right?

Motivation
----------

This project is nostalgic.  It is interesting to look inside a relic I created as a teenager, and compare old and new methodology.  The old was much worse in just about every way, but has charm in being so close to the hardware.

Objective
---------

Create a release targeting Apple \]\[ plus and //e.  The release should take the form of floppy disk images, and should be tested on two or more emulators.  It should also be tested on vintage hardware, to the extent possible.

Scope
-----

1. Cleanup the BASIC taking advantage of modern editors and scripting capabilities.
2. Rediscover workings of machine code.
3. Fill out the story elements, and produce a manual.
4. Write wiki pages discussing details.

Boundaries
----------

1. Do not disturb any of the original artwork.
2. Do not disturb any of the original sprites (there is one small exception).
3. Do not disturb any of the original maps.
4. Do not change fundamentals of game mechanics.

Story Synopsis
===============

Mordock, former Archwizard of Lemphocym, has re-discovered the secrets of the pyramid gates, and taken up his abode in cryptic Wornoth.  From his ethereal stronghold he sends forth the rays of nightmare, and troubles all the Realms.  I, Xavier Francis, eighteenth Baron Lemphocym, attempted an assault on the Iron Tower, and failed.  Find me in the Black Fortress, in unpeopled Fonkrakis, and we will make a last desperate attempt to end the reign of the nightmare dreamer.
