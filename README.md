*Realm* Overview
=================

*Realm* is an adventure game written in the 1980's for Apple \]\[, but never released until 2021. Today it can be played on emulators or vintage computers.  See the [wiki](https://github.com/dfgordon/Realm/wiki) for more.

Story Synopsis
===============

Mordock, former Archwizard of Lemphocym, has re-discovered the secrets of the pyramid gates, and taken up his abode in cryptic Wornoth.  From his ethereal stronghold he sends forth the rays of nightmare, and troubles all the Realms.  I, Xavier Francis, eighteenth Baron Lemphocym, attempted an assault on the Iron Tower, and failed.  Find me in the Black Fortress, in unpeopled Fonkrakis, and we will make a last desperate attempt to end the reign of the nightmare dreamer.

Project
=======

The goal of this project was originally to recover and preserve *Realm* as it was conceived in the 1980's.  This goal was met with version 1.2.  Version 1.2 is something like "the *Realm* that could have been."

Later versions add things that would have been hard to achieve with available resources in the retro-era, while preserving gameplay mechanics, story elements, maps, and artwork.  With version 1.4 a lot of code has been significantly reworked, including all-new assembly language.

All versions remain playable on the original development platform - a 48K Apple \]\[ plus, with one or two 5.25" floppy drives.
